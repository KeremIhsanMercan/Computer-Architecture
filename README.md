# Computer-Architecture
This is a CPU Simulation project written in Verilog with Vivado. It simulates severel register files, an ALU Unit and a memory in a basic CPU. It also has a hard wired control unit to give pre-defined commands.
# What I Learned
- How CPUs work
- How ALUs work
- How to write to memory and read from memory
- How CPU parts communicate
- How to write Verilog
- How to use Vivado
- How hard wired control units work
- How to build CPU instructions
